# ToDo

### Short term
- x axis scale by years, not months
- instead of 0 to 1, make the sliders 0 to 100%
- hover text for the plot
- year breakdown?
- change text of amt pain to "amt paid to loan"
- standardize y axis for marks every 10k? 20k?

### Long term
- inflation?
- fix themes so ggplot2 font is the same as base font
